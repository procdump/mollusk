//! wincode is a fast, bincode‑compatible serializer/deserializer focused on in‑place
//! initialization and direct memory writes.
//!
//! In short, `wincode` operates over traits that facilitate direct writes of memory
//! into final destinations (including heap-allocated buffers) without intermediate
//! staging buffers.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! `wincode` traits are implemented for many built-in types (like `Vec`, integers, etc.).
//!
//! You'll most likely want to start by using `wincode` on your own struct types, which can be
//! done easily with the derive macros.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! # use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//! # use wincode_derive::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//! # #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//! #
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     data: Vec<u8>,
//!     win: bool,
//! }
//!
//! let val = MyStruct { data: vec![1,2,3], win: true };
//! assert_eq!(wincode::serialize(&val).unwrap(), bincode::serialize(&val).unwrap());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! Typical Rust API design employs a *construct-then-move* style of programming.
//! Common APIs like `Vec::push`, iterator adaptors, `Box::new` (and its `Rc`/`Arc`
//! variants), and even returning a fully-initialized struct from a function all
//! follow this pattern. While this style feels intuitive and ergonomic, it
//! inherently entails copying unless the compiler can perform elision -- which,
//! today, it generally cannot. To see why this is a consequence of the design,
//! consider the following code:
//! ```
//! # struct MyStruct;
//! # impl MyStruct {
//! #     fn new() -> Self {
//! #         MyStruct
//! #     }
//! # }
//! Box::new(MyStruct::new());
//! ```
//! `MyStruct` must be constructed *before* it can be moved into `Box`'s allocation.
//! This is a classic code ordering problem: to avoid the copy, `Box::new` needs
//! to execute code before `MyStruct::new()` runs. `Vec::push`, iterator collection,
//! and similar APIs have this same problem.
//! (See these [design meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/XXuVXH46T8StJB_y0urnYg) or
//! or the
//! [`placement-by-return` RFC](https://github.com/PoignardAzur/rust-rfcs/blob/placement-by-return/text/0000-placement-by-return.md)
//! for a more in-depth discussion on this topic.) The result of this is that even
//! performance conscious developers routinely introduce avoidable copying without
//! realizing it. `serde` inherits these issues since it neither attempts to
//! initialize in‑place nor exposes APIs to do so.
//!
//! These patterns are not inherent limitations of Rust, but are consequences of
//! conventions and APIs that do not consider in-place initialization as part of
//! their design. The tools for in-place construction *do* exist (see
//! [`MaybeUninit`](core::mem::MaybeUninit) and raw pointer APIs), but they are
//! rarely surfaced in libraries and can be cumbersome to use (see [`addr_of_mut!`](core::ptr::addr_of_mut)),
//! so programmers are often not even aware of them or avoid them.
//!
//! `wincode` makes in-place initialization a first class design goal, and fundamentally
//! operates on [traits](#traits) that facilitate direct writes of memory.
//!
//! # Adapting foreign types
//!
//! `wincode` can also be used to implement serialization/deserialization
//! on foreign types, where serialization/deserialization schemes on those types are unoptimized (and
//! out of your control as a foreign type). For example, consider the following struct,
//! defined outside of your crate:
//! ```
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//!
//! # #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! #[derive(Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! struct Address([u8; 32]);
//!
//! # #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! #[derive(Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! struct Hash([u8; 32]);
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! pub struct A {
//!     pub addresses: Vec<Address>,
//!     pub hash: Hash,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `serde`'s default, naive, implementation will perform per-element visitation of all bytes
//! in `Vec<Address>` and `Hash`. Because these fields are "plain old data", ideally we would
//! avoid per-element visitation entirely and read / write these fields in a single pass.
//! The situation worsens if this struct needs to be written into a heap allocated data structure,
//! like a `Vec<A>` or `Box<[A]>`. As discussed in [motivation](#motivation), all
//! those bytes will be initialized on the stack before being copied into the heap allocation.
//!
//! `wincode` can solve this with the following:
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! # use wincode::{Serialize as _, Deserialize as _, containers::{self, Pod}};
//! # use wincode_derive::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//! mod foreign_crate {
//!     // Defined in some foreign crate...
//!     use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//!
//!     # #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//!     #[repr(transparent)]
//!     #[derive(Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//!     pub struct Address(pub [u8; 32]);
//!
//!     # #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//!     #[repr(transparent)]
//!     #[derive(Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//!     pub struct Hash(pub [u8; 32]);
//!
//!     # #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
//!     #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//!     pub struct A {
//!         pub addresses: Vec<Address>,
//!         pub hash: Hash,
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! #[wincode(from = "foreign_crate::A")]
//! pub struct MyA {
//!     addresses: Vec<Pod<foreign_crate::Address>>,
//!     hash: Pod<foreign_crate::Hash>,
//! }
//!
//! let val = foreign_crate::A {
//!     addresses: vec![foreign_crate::Address([0; 32]), foreign_crate::Address([1; 32])],
//!     hash: foreign_crate::Hash([0; 32]),
//! };
//! let bincode_serialize = bincode::serialize(&val).unwrap();
//! let wincode_serialize = MyA::serialize(&val).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(bincode_serialize, wincode_serialize);
//!
//! let bincode_deserialize: foreign_crate::A = bincode::deserialize(&bincode_serialize).unwrap();
//! let wincode_deserialize = MyA::deserialize(&bincode_serialize).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(val, bincode_deserialize);
//! assert_eq!(val, wincode_deserialize);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Now, when deserializing `A`:
//! - All initialization is done in-place, including heap-allocated memory
//!   (true of all supported contiguous heap-allocated structures in `wincode`).
//! - Byte fields are read and written in a single pass.
//!
//! # Compatibility
//!
//! - Produces the same bytes as `bincode` for the covered shapes when using bincode's
//!   default configuration, provided your [`SchemaWrite`] and [`SchemaRead`] schemas and
//!   [`containers`] match the layout implied by your `serde` types.
//! - Length encodings are pluggable via [`SeqLen`](len::SeqLen).
//! - Unlike `bincode`, this crate will fail to serialize or deserialize large
//!   dynamic data structures by default, but this can be configured. This is
//!   done for security and performance, as it allows to preallocate these data
//!   structures safely.
//!
//! # Zero-copy deserialization
//!
//! `wincode`'s zero-copy deserialization is built on the following primitives:
//! - [`u8`]
//! - [`i8`]
//!
//! In addition to the following on little endian targets:
//! - [`u16`], [`i16`], [`u32`], [`i32`], [`u64`], [`i64`], [`u128`], [`i128`], [`f32`], [`f64`]
//!
//! Types with alignment greater than 1 can force the compiler to insert padding into your structs.
//! Zero-copy requires padding-free layouts; if the layout has implicit padding, `wincode` will not
//! qualify the type as zero-copy.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Within `wincode`, any type that is composed entirely of the above primitives is
//! eligible for zero-copy deserialization. This includes arrays, slices, and structs.
//!
//! Structs deriving [`SchemaRead`] are eligible for zero-copy deserialization
//! as long as they are composed entirely of the above zero-copy types, are annotated with
//! `#[repr(transparent)]` or `#[repr(C)]`, and have no implicit padding. Use appropriate
//! field ordering or add explicit padding fields if needed to eliminate implicit padding.
//!
//! Note that tuples are **not** eligible for zero-copy deserialization, as Rust does not
//! currently guarantee tuple layout.
//!
//! ## Field reordering
//! If your struct has implicit padding, you may be able to reorder fields to avoid it.
//!
//! ```
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct HasPadding {
//!    a: u8,
//!    b: u32,
//!    c: u16,
//!    d: u8,
//! }
//!
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct ZeroPadding {
//!    b: u32,
//!    c: u16,
//!    a: u8,
//!    d: u8,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Explicit padding
//! You may need to add an explicit padding field if reordering fields cannot yield
//! a padding-free layout.
//!
//! ```
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct HasPadding {
//!    a: u32,
//!    b: u16,
//!    _pad: [u8; 2],
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### `&[u8]`
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! use wincode::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! struct ByteRef<'a> {
//!     bytes: &'a [u8],
//! }
//!
//! let bytes: Vec<u8> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let byte_ref = ByteRef { bytes: &bytes };
//! let serialized = wincode::serialize(&byte_ref).unwrap();
//! let deserialized: ByteRef<'_> = wincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(byte_ref, deserialized);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### struct newtype
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! # use rand::random;
//! # use std::array;
//! use wincode::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! struct Signature([u8; 64]);
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! struct Data<'a> {
//!     signature: &'a Signature,
//!     data: &'a [u8],
//! }
//!
//! let signature = Signature(array::from_fn(|_| random()));
//! let data = Data {
//!     signature: &signature,
//!     data: &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
//! };
//! let serialized = wincode::serialize(&data).unwrap();
//! let deserialized: Data<'_> = wincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(data, deserialized);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ### `&[u8; N]`
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! use wincode::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! struct HeaderRef<'a> {
//!     magic: &'a [u8; 7],
//! }
//!
//! let header = HeaderRef { magic: b"W1NC0D3" };
//! let serialized = wincode::serialize(&header).unwrap();
//! let deserialized: HeaderRef<'_> = wincode::deserialize(&serialized).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(header, deserialized);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## In-place mutation
//!
//! wincode supports in-place mutation of zero-copy types.
//! See [`deserialize_mut`] or [`ZeroCopy::from_bytes_mut`] for more details.
//!
//! ## `ZeroCopy` and `config::ZeroCopy` methods
//!
//! The [`ZeroCopy`] and [`config::ZeroCopy`] traits provide some convenience methods for
//! working with zero-copy types.
//!
//! See those trait definitions for more details.
//!
//! # Crate Features
//!
//! |Feature|Default|Description
//! |---|---|---|
//! |`std`|enabled|Enables `std` support.|
//! |`alloc`|enabled automatically when `std` is enabled|Enables `alloc` support.|
//! |`solana-short-vec`|disabled|Enables `solana-short-vec` support.|
//! |`derive`|disabled|Enables the derive macros for [`SchemaRead`] and [`SchemaWrite`].|
//! |`uuid`|disabled|Enables support for the `uuid` crate.|
//! |`uuid-serde-compat`|disabled|Encodes and decodes `uuid::Uuid` with an additional length prefix, making it compatible with `serde`'s serialization scheme. Note that enabling this will result in strictly worse performance.|
//!
//! # Derive attributes
//!
//! ## Top level
//! |Attribute|Type|Default|Description
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! |`from`|`Type`|`None`|Indicates that type is a mapping from another type (example in previous section)|
//! |`no_suppress_unused`|`bool`|`false`|Disable unused field lints suppression. Only usable on structs with `from`.|
//! |`struct_extensions` (DEPRECATED)|`bool`|`false`|Generates placement initialization helpers on `SchemaRead` struct implementations. DEPRECATED; Use `#[derive(UninitBuilder)]` instead.|
//! |`tag_encoding`|`Type`|`None`|Specifies the encoding/decoding schema to use for the variant discriminant. Only usable on enums.|
//! |`assert_zero_copy`|`bool`\|`Path`|`false`|Generates compile-time asserts to ensure the type meets zero-copy requirements. Can specify a custom config path, will use the [`DefaultConfig`](config::DefaultConfig) if `bool` form is used.|
//!
//! ### `no_suppress_unused`
//!
//! When creating a mapping type with `#[wincode(from = "AnotherType")]`, fields are typically
//! comprised of [`containers`] (of course not strictly always true). As a result, these structs
//! purely exist for the compiler to generate optimized implementations, and are never actually
//! constructed. As a result, unused field lints will be triggered, which can be annoying.
//! By default, when `from` is used, the derive macro will generate dummy function that references all
//! the struct fields, which suppresses those lints. This function will ultimately be compiled out of your
//! build, but you can disable this by setting `no_suppress_unused` to `true`. You can also avoid
//! these lint errors with visibility modifiers (e.g., `pub`).
//!
//! Note that this only works on structs, as it is not possible to construct an arbitrary enum variant.
//!
//! ### `tag_encoding`
//!
//! Allows specifying the encoding/decoding schema to use for the variant discriminant. Only usable on enums.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//! There is no bincode analog to this attribute.
//! Specifying this attribute will make your enum incompatible with bincode's default enum encoding.
//! If you need strict bincode compatibility, you should implement a custom <code>Deserialize</code> and
//! <code>Serialize</code> impl for your enum on the serde / bincode side.
//! </div>
//!
//! Example:
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "derive", feature = "alloc"))] {
//! use wincode::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! #[wincode(tag_encoding = "u8")]
//! enum Enum {
//!     A,
//!     B,
//!     C,
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(&wincode::serialize(&Enum::B).unwrap(), &1u8.to_le_bytes());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Field level
//! |Attribute|Type|Default|Description
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! |`with`|`Type`|`None`|Overrides the default `SchemaRead` or `SchemaWrite` implementation for the field.|
//! |`skip`|`bool`\|`Expr`|`false`|Skips the field during serialization and deserialization (initializing with default value).|
//!
//! ### `skip`
//!
//! Allows omitting the field during serialization and deserialization. When type is initialized
//! during deserialization, the field will be set to the default value. This is typically
//! `Default::default()` (when using `#[wincode(skip)]` or `#[wincode(skip(default))]`), but can
//! be overridden by specifying `#[wincode(skip(default_val = <value>))]`.
//!
//! ## Variant level (enum variants)
//! |Attribute|Type|Default|Description
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! |`tag`|`Expr`|`None`|Specifies the discriminant expression for the variant. Only usable on enums.|
//!
//! ### `tag`
//!
//! Specifies the discriminant expression for the variant. Only usable on enums.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//! There is no bincode analog to this attribute.
//! Specifying this attribute will make your enum incompatible with bincode's default enum encoding.
//! If you need strict bincode compatibility, you should implement a custom <code>Deserialize</code> and
//! <code>Serialize</code> impl for your enum on the serde / bincode side.
//! </div>
//!
//! Example:
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "derive", feature = "alloc"))] {
//! use wincode::{SchemaWrite, SchemaRead};
//!
//! #[derive(SchemaWrite, SchemaRead)]
//! enum Enum {
//!     #[wincode(tag = 5)]
//!     A,
//!     #[wincode(tag = 8)]
//!     B,
//!     #[wincode(tag = 13)]
//!     C,
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(&wincode::serialize(&Enum::A).unwrap(), &5u32.to_le_bytes());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # UninitBuilder
//!
//! You may have some exotic serialization logic that requires you to implement `SchemaRead` manually
//! for a type. In these scenarios, you'll likely want to leverage some additional helper methods
//! to reduce the amount of boilerplate that is typically required when dealing with uninitialized
//! fields.
//!
//! `#[derive(UninitBuilder)]` generates a corresponding uninit builder struct for the type.
//! The name of the builder struct is the name of the type with `UninitBuilder` appended.
//! E.g., `Header` -> `HeaderUninitBuilder`.
//!
//! The builder has automatic initialization tracking that does bookkeeping of which fields have been initialized.
//! Calling `write_<field_name>` or `read_<field_name>`, for example, will mark the field as
//! initialized so that it's properly dropped if the builder is dropped on error or panic.
//!
//! The builder struct has the following methods:
//! - `from_maybe_uninit_mut`
//!   - Creates a new builder from a mutable `MaybeUninit` reference to the type.
//! - `into_assume_init_mut`
//!   - Assumes the builder is fully initialized, drops it, and returns a mutable reference to the inner type.
//! - `finish`
//!   - Forgets the builder, disabling the drop logic.
//! - `is_init`
//!   - Checks if the builder is fully initialized by checking if all field initialization bits are set.
//!
//! For each field, the builder struct provides the following methods:
//! - `uninit_<field_name>_mut`
//!   - Gets a mutable `MaybeUninit` projection to the `<field_name>` slot.
//! - `read_<field_name>`
//!   - Reads into a `MaybeUninit`'s `<field_name>` slot from the given [`Reader`](io::Reader).
//! - `write_<field_name>`
//!   - Writes a `MaybeUninit`'s `<field_name>` slot with the given value.
//! - `init_<field_name>_with`
//!   - Initializes the `<field_name>` slot with a given initializer function.
//! - `assume_init_<field_name>`
//!   - Marks the `<field_name>` slot as initialized.
//!
//! #### Safety
//!
//! Correct code will call `finish` or `into_assume_init_mut` once all fields have been initialized.
//! Failing to do so will result in the initialized fields being dropped when the builder is dropped, which
//! is undefined behavior if the `MaybeUninit` is later assumed to be initialized (e.g., on successful deserialization).
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(all(feature = "alloc", feature = "derive"))] {
//! # use wincode::{SchemaRead, SchemaWrite, io::Reader, error::ReadResult, config::Config, UninitBuilder};

//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
//! #[derive(SchemaRead, SchemaWrite, UninitBuilder)]
//! struct Header {
//!     num_required_signatures: u8,
//!     num_signed_accounts: u8,
//!     num_unsigned_accounts: u8,
//! }
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]

//! struct Message {

//!                 // declaration order, and we need to ensure `header_builder` is dropped
//!                 // before `payload_builder` in the event of an error or panic.
//!                 let mut payload_builder = PayloadUninitBuilder::<C>::from_maybe_uninit_mut(payload);
//!                 // payload.header will be marked as initialized if the function succeeds.

//!                 })?;
//!                 // Alternatively, we could have done `payload_builder.read_header(reader.by_ref())?;`
//!                 // rather than reading all the fields individually.
//!                 payload_builder.read_data(reader.by_ref())?;
//!                 // Payload is fully initialized, so we forget the builder
//!                 // to avoid dropping the initialized fields.
//!                 payload_builder.finish();
//!                 Ok(())
//!             })?;
//!         }
//!         // Message is fully initialized.
//!         msg_builder.finish();
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
